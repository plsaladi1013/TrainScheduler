# TrainSchedule

This application shows the time table for the trains loaded in my firebase database.</br>
The Next Arrival & the Minutes Away column values refresh every 1 min.</br>
You can load a new train record by filling the "train" form below the time table section.</br>
You can also delete a train record by clicking on the "Trash" button on the right side in the record</br>
Every time you add a new train or remove a train, the timer restarts the countdown from 60 to 0.
